# KNIPSS Alumini  Web Page Project

## Introduction

KNIPSS Alumni Network is an initiative that aims to create a platform for alumni of Kamla Nehru Institute of Physical And Social Science (KNIPSS) to connect, communicate, and collaborate with each other. As a volunteer effort, this project seeks to create a user-friendly and visually appealing website that can be accessed by alumni regardless of their technical expertise.

One of the key features of the KNIPSS Alumni Web Page is a list of honorable alumni who have passed out of the institution. This list serves as an inspiration for current students and a testament to the excellence of KNIPSS alumni. The website has been created using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to ensure that it is easy to navigate and visually appealing.
